# Project Title 
Landing Page

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

the landing page has a navigation bar, which ,on click on one of its elements, uses an animation to scroll to the chosen element.

the navigation bar was added using html, but styled using CSS that was modified with JavaScript.

the code declares variables containing the different components of the navigation bar, which are used later to change the style with hovering and scroll when clicking.

active classes are added to each section as it's displayed in the viewport and then removed when it's no longer displayed.

there's a button at the very bottom of the page that's used to scroll all the way to the top with an animation.

there are notes in every part of the code explaining what each function and method does.

the scrollbar was customized to go better with the color of the page using css.

the cursor changes when hover over any of the navigation bar elements or the page footer to indicate that they're clickable.

the navigation bar elements are now styled whenever the relevant section is detected on screen.

the section detection works on smaller devices and tablets as well.

the code is as compact as possible to eliminate redundancy.
